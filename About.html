      <p>
        Aang was and air bender and he was 12 when he ran away because he found
        out he was going to be the next Avater and wasn't ready,because he was
        going to loose all his friends and had to focus on his training to
        become the Avater. There was 4 nation which includes the basic element
        of nature...Fire,Water,Earth and Air. The fire nation started a war and
        on the hunt of the 12 year old kid (Aang),and destroyed all the air
        nation becuase that was where the next Avater would have been born, he
        was later found by 2 other kids katara and sokka in an iceberg frozen
        for 100 years. The feed him up to date to date of what has happened in
        the last 100 years and now he has to master all the elements to defeat
        the fire nation and save the world. with the help of people they met
        along their journey and also oppositions, it took a whole year for the
        Avater to learn all the elemenmts and fight the firelord.
